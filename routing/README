The desired interface is:
intput:
topology * set of demands * output of previous computation

output is data structure:
source * dest -> set of (path * probabilities)

Or, ideally: 
An object that describes a prob distribution over paths, with a 
method to "draw a random sample"

Algorithms:
  - VLB
  - Shortest Path First 
  - Centralized optimal MCF
  - ECMP
  - Multiplicative weights (Auerbach and Kandekahr) 
  - Raecke
  - Distributed gradient descent* (this might become N algorithms)
  - Heuristic MCF (variation with limited churn, yet to be designed)
