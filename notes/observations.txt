Mcf 
  - Can minimize congestion on one edge, but ignore the others. 
  - Sensitive to accuracy of prediction
MwMcf 
Vlb 
  - Need to be careful about how paths are selected. Choosing
    shortest paths deterministically can lead to hotspots
  - Need to remove "loops" in route
Ecmp 
  - Poor choice if there are "shortcuts" in the topology
    or if lots of traffic hashes to the same path 
Spf 
Raeke
  - Does Raeke always perform poorly?
AkMcf 
  - Ak seems like it takes too many iterations to be practical
