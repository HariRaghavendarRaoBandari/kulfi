Title: Achieving High Utilization with Software-Driven WAN
URL: http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/192928/tr2013-swan.pdf
Routing Summary: max-min fairness via an LP
Evaluation Summary:
  - Small topologies: synthetic mix of interactive, elastic, background
  - Larger topology: gravity model, hand tuned
Notes:
  Essentially synthetic, hand-tuned to resemble the kinds of patterns
  that arise in practice.

Title: Traffic Engineering with Forward Fault Correction (SIGCOMM 2014)
URL: http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/219693/sigcomm2014-ffc.pdf
Routing: Compactly encoding constraints due to faults and solving using sorting networks
Evaluation:
    * Small experiments on HW testbed. Simulations for larger topology and real data.
    * HW testbed emulates a WAN. Use iperf to generate UDP flows with specified rates. Artificial demands to show specific scenario.
    * Simulation: Data from real networks. Size of flows for in an interval is set to average bandwidth consumed during the interval (5 min).
Notes:
Similar to how we are evaluating.

Title: Calendaring for Wide Area Networks (SIGCOMM 2014)
URL: http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/217883/sigc334-kandula.pdf
Routing: Online temporal planning scheme to pack long flows across paths and future time. Uses LP.
Evaluation:
    * TMs from Microsoft's WAN containing 5-min avg demand between endpoints.
    * Results based only on simulation. No harware testbed results.
    * Real topology with 40 nodes and 280 edges. Larger synthetic topologies.
    * Realistic 5-min avg traffic demand. Synthetic flow sizes based on distribution.
Notes:
    * No HW results; Simulations: real small topology, sythetic large topologies.

Title: Walking the Tightrope: Responsive Yet Stable Traffic Engineering (SIGCOMM 2005)
URL: http://nms.lcs.mit.edu/papers/sigcomm05_kandula.pdf
Routing: Online distributed TE protocol to balance load, responding to varying demands and failures
Evaluation:
    * Simulations based on Rocketfuel topology
    * Gravity model to estimate TMs; Also experiments on sythetic demands.
    * More topologies based on GT_ITM (http://www.cc.gatech.edu/fac/Ellen.Zegura/graphs.html)

Title: Inter-Datacenter Bulk Transfers with NetStitcher (SIGCOMM 2011)
URL: https://www.cs.duke.edu/~msirivia/publications/netstitcher-sigcomm.pdf
Routing: A system that employs a network of storage nodes to stitch together unutilized bandwidth, whenever
and wherever it exists. It gathers information about leftover resources, uses a store-and-forward algorithm to schedule data transfers, and adapts to resource fluctuations
Evaluation:
    * Testbed evaluation as well as live CDN deployment
    * Uses topology and TM from Equinix DCN and WAN
    * No information about the flow-level scheduling in testbed experiments as they focussed on bulk data transfer. They used a 4-day trace of CDN operational deployment.
